# Bed Time Story 
This is the result from my live stream coding. And it is a small example to demonstrate "model, view, controller" pattern. 

# Installation 

Create a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install flask
```

# Execute 

```
python3 app.py
```

And the app can be access on http:/127.0.0.1:5000
